# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Identification

 Rice leaf disease detection is the technique of finding and diagnosing illnesses that harm rice plants by examining the traits and patterns seen on their leaves. This is often accomplished using techniques from techniques of machine learning and computer vision. In the realm of precision farming, the detection of issues affecting rice leaves is a critical component to ensure timely interventions and maximize crop yield. This project aims to harness the power of techniques of machine learning, computer vision, and image processing for developing robust process for automated identification and analysis for deficiency conditions.



**SCOPE**

The goal of this project is to use machine learning, computer vision, and image processing techniques to create a robust process for automated deficiency identification and analysis.Rice leaf photos are frequently classified as healthy or unhealthy using machine learning models based on learned characteristics and patterns extracted from the images.


**DATASET**

In this project, we used rice leaf disease dataset that holds pictures of disease infected rice plant leaves. This dataset includes 120 jpg 
images of disease contaminated rice leaves. The pictures are divided within three categories according to the type of disease. They are 
leaf smut, brown spot, and bacterial blights. There are 40 images in each category. These images area obtained from agricultural research 
institutions, field surveys.

**CONCLUSION**

A comparison between three distinct machine learning techniques, for example ran dom forest, decision tree, and logistic regression. The algorithms predicted rice leaf diseases with changing levels of accuracy. Below table shows the comparison between the values-of accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score of all three algorithms. The ran dom forest and decision tree algorithms predicted with same accuracy because of the nature of dataset. As the dataset is simple and with no complex data, random forest algorithm is mostly used for larger and complex data. So, we prefer decision tree al gorithm compared to others and was found to perform the best, with 95.4545 accuracy. Wecanexpand the number of disease classes and photos in our dataset, even though we just apply the suggested strategy to three distinct disease types.
